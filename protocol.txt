18-35 year old subjects with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated
in an fMRI experiment to 1) locate their PPA brain area and 2) look at
modulations in the PPA area when seeing patterns of repetions in scene imagery.
they lay in a Allegra 3T scanner with a mirror on the head coil reflecting
projected stimuli. TR length was 1.5s. 6s of rest were allotted at the start of
the experiment, to allow the scanner signal to settle. subjects were allowed
one minute of rest between each task.

Task 1:
subjects fixated on a dot in the center of the screen, and viewed blocks of
house images. each block consisted of 12 trials. on each trial, subjects were
shown a photo of a house for 0.5s. subjects had 1.3s from the time the photo
was shown to indicate whether the photo was a repeat of the photo immediately
preceeding it. the next trial began 0.2s later, with the start of the next TR.
blocks were separated by 12s rest between blocks (HrHrHr...).

Task 2:
subjects fixated on a dot in the center of the screen, and viewed an
uninterrupted stream of scene images. on each trial, subjects were shown a photo
of a scene for 0.5s. subjects had 1.3s from the time the photo was shown to
indicate whether the scene was indoor or outdoor. the next trial began 0.2s
later, with the start of the next TR. subjects did this task in two separate
runs.
